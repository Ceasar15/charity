              <p class="probootstrap-news-date">Jan 20, 2021 by Admin</p>
              <p>
                One of Silicon Valley’s most valuable private fintech companies has chosen Dubai for its first expansion into the Middle East and North Africa.

                Online payments company Stripe is expanding into the Middle East, just weeks after its latest funding round, which pushed the company’s value to $95 billion, making it one of the most valuable private fintech firms in the world.
                
                “The opportunity for start-ups in the UAE is enormous,” Matt Henderson, Stripe’s business lead for Europe, Middle East, Africa told CNBC’s Hadley Gamble on Monday in an exclusive interview. “The opportunity for Stripe is very large as well.”
                
                Stripe, started in 2010 by two brothers from Ireland, competes directly with PayPal, Adyen and Square. Its software platform allows businesses to accept online payments.
                
                Co-founders Patrick and John Collison, who are 32 and 30 respectively, are each worth over $11 billion.
                Why Dubai?
                
                “The UAE has clearly got a booming digital economy,” Henderson told CNBC. Businesses operating online in the UAE can now use Stripe to accept online payments.
                
                Gym management software Glofox, already a global user of Stripe, said in a statement that Stripe’s launch in the UAE “can be a catalyst for global brands like ours to expand the products and services we’re able to offer to fitness businesses in the region.”
                
                The benefit of bringing Stripe’s technology to Dubai, Henderson adds, is that “there are a lot of great local businesses that haven’t yet globalized. One of the ways that will help them grow and therefore help them to resonate with investors is opening up these new markets.”</p>

              <p class="probootstrap-news-date">Mar 21, 2021 by Admin</p>
              <p>Digital gig workers often have somewhat-high income levels compared to non-digital, daily-wage workers like domestic workers or agricultural laborers. For example, several digital gig workers in India told us that they had bought land or were helping pay for family expenses, both suggesting some level of financial security. 

                Although incomes may be higher, these workers remain financially vulnerable given how unpredictable their incomes and expenses can be. In fact, workers told us their income often runs out before the end of the month, which was the case even before the pandemic. 
                
                Gig workers need access to liquidity to continue working. Unlike other vulnerable daily-wage or informal workers, digital gig workers need money to be able to access their work (much like farmers need capital for seeds, etc.). A gig worker without cash for airtime, petrol, car repairs, or insurance cannot work, thereby creating a sort of gig-work poverty trap. The ride-hailing drivers we spoke to echoed these worries, noting their concerns about paying for car insurance and license fees, as well as repaying car loans. 

                KarmaLife’s instant line-of-credit is a valuable source of liquidity for these essential expenses, both to extend salaries and to ensure workers can continue working. We found that Karmalife users are less likely to run out of cash before the end of the month. In fact, even a few months after signing up for KarmaLife, users are twice as likely to report not running out of money at the end of the month.

              <p class="probootstrap-news-date">Feb 20, 2021 by Admin</p>
              <p>U.S. stocks rose on Wednesday as investors digested the first batch of corporate earnings.

                The S&P 500 gained 0.2% after closing at a record high in the previous session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 180 points. The Nasdaq Composite traded up 0.2%.
                
                Shares of Goldman Sachs climbed 3% after the bank blew past analysts’ expectations with record first-quarter net profits and revenues on strong performance from the firm’s equities trading and investment banking units.
                
                JPMorgan Chase beat analysts’ estimates on top and bottom lines, helped by a $5.2 billion benefit from releasing money it had previously set aside for loan losses that didn’t develop. Shares of JPMorgan dipped about 1%.
                
                Wells Fargo also reported earnings and revenue that exceeded expectations for its first quarter. The stock was slightly lower.
                
                Bank stocks have risen sharply so far this year, with the KBW Bank Index easily outpacing the S&P 500. 
                
                Reopening plays recouped some of the losses from the previous session amid a halt to the rollout of the Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccine. American Airlines rose 2%, while United Airlines climbed nearly 3%. Carnival, Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean all gained at least 1%.
                
                On Tuesday, The Food and Drug Administration called for a pause in administering J&J’s Covid-19 vaccine after six people in the U.S. developed a rare disorder involving blood clots.
                
                Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said the drugmaker can deliver 10% more vaccine doses to the U.S. by the end of May than previously expected. Plus, Moderna said its Covid-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective at protecting against the virus six months after a person’s second shot.
                
                The Labor Department’s consumer price index came in slightly hotter than expected on Tuesday. The CPI rose 0.6% from the previous month but 2.6% from the same period a year ago. Economists polled by Dow Jones projected the headline index to rise by 0.5% month-over-month and 2.5% year-over-year.
                
                Market participants will also be watching for the Coinbase direct listing on Wednesday. Crypto investors are hailing the company’s stock market debut as a major milestone for the industry after years of skepticism from Wall Street and regulators. The price of bitcoin surged to a fresh record high of more than $63,500 on Tuesday.

              <p class="probootstrap-news-date">July 23, 2020 by Admin</p>
              <p>The company told Reuters it had launched the pilot program with payment and crypto platform Crypto.com and plans to offer the option to more partners later this year.

                Bitcoin, the most popular crypto coin, jumped to a one-week high on the news, rising as much as 4.5% to $58,300 and heading back toward a record-high above $61,000 hit earlier this month.
                
                Visa subsequently confirmed the news in a statement.
                
                The USD Coin (USDC) is a stablecoin cryptocurrency whose value is pegged directly to the U.S. dollar.
                
                Visa’s move comes as finance firms including BNY Mellon, BlackRock Inc and Mastercard Inc take steps to make more use of cryptocurrencies for investment and payment purposes.
                
                The cryptocurrency wallet will deposit traditional fiat currency in a bank account, to be wired to Visa at the end of the day to settle any transactions, adding cost and complexity for businesses.

                Visa’s latest step, which will use the ethereum blockchain, strips out the need to convert digital coin into traditional money in order for the transaction to be settled.

                Visa said it has partnered with digital asset bank Anchorage and completed the first transaction this month — with Crypto.com sending USDC to Visa’s Ethereum address at Anchorage.

              <p class="probootstrap-news-date">July 20, 2020 by Admin</p>
              <p>The startup will use the cash injection to build the business, with plans to launch its first products this summer, Ryan Glover, Greenwood’s Chairman and co-founder said in an interview.

                PNC Financial Services Group Inc, Mastercard Inc, Visa Inc, FIS, Banco Popular, as well as several venture capital firms such as SoftBank’s Opportunity Fund, also participated in the round.
                
                First announced in October, Greenwood was created to provide online banking services to help close the wealth gap faced by Black and Latino communities in the United States. It plans to offer services such as non-predatory loans, as well as the ability for customers to round up purchases and donate what they save to organizations aimed at advancing their communities.
                
                Greenwood is one of several digital banks that have emerged over the past year focused on consumers and businesses that have traditionally been underserved by the mainstream financial sector. Other online banking startups include First Boulevard, Daylight and Cheese.
                
                Founded by entrepreneur Glover, alongside Civil Rights leader Andrew J. Young and rapper and activist Michael “Killer Mike” Render, Greenwood has signed up more than 500,000 users to its waitlist since being announced.
                
                “This multi generational wealth gap problem will take an all hands on deck solution,” said Glover, noting that the startup’s mosaic of new large investors could help it advance its ambitious goal. “It will take collaboration and community to advance racial equality and financial empowerment.”</p>
